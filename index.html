                    The recent release of GPT-4 marks a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing. In this article, we offer a thorough analysis of its advanced capabilities and delve into the history and development of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), and what new capabilities GPT-4 unlocks. Check out our article on GPT-4 Turbo, the latest iteration of GPT, to find out more.

                What are Generative Pre-trained Transformers?
                Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) are a type of deep learning model used to generate human-like text. Common uses include

                answering questions
                summarizing text
                translating text to other languages
                generating code
                generating blog posts, stories, conversations, and other content types. 
                There are endless applications for GPT models, and you can even fine-tune them on specific data to create even better results. By using transformers, you will be saving costs on computing, time, and other resources.

                    Before GPT
                    The current AI revolution for natural language only became possible with the invention of transformer models, starting with Google's BERT in 2017. Before this, text generation was performed with other deep learning models, such as recursive neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs). These performed well for outputting single words or short phrases but could not generate realistic longer content.
                    <br>
                    BERT's transformer approach was a major breakthrough since it is not a supervised learning technique. That is, it did not require an expensive annotated dataset to train it. BERT was used by Google for interpreting natural language searches, however, it cannot generate text from a prompt.
